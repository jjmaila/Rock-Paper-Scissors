## Challenges that I faced 
The challenge that i went during this project was javascript and know how to use it in the code. I never did javascrip or used it, that was a challenge for this project and seeing the error. The error waas a struggle for me and seeing how it was either the spelling. I see how the javascript works when everything can be rigt but there is only one thing that wrong can change the whole websit.
