## Description
Rock, Paper, Scissors is a game you can play against the computer. Rock, Paper, Scissors is a classic two-person game. The player starts the round by saying "Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!" every time they say "shoot," each player holds out their fist for rock, flat hand for paper, and index and middle finger for scissors. Rock crushes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper covers rock. And see who wins the round each time.

## Challenges that I faced 
My challenge during this project was JavaScript and knowing how to use it in the code. I never did javascript or used it, that was a challenge for this project and seeing the error. The error was a struggle for me and seeing how it was either the spelling. I see how JavaScript works when everything can be right, but only one thing can change the whole website.
