Description
Rock, Paper, Scissors is a game that you can play against the computer. Rock, Paper, Scissors is a classic two person game. The player starts the round by saying "rock, paper, scissors, shoot!" every time they say "shoot," each player holds out their fist for rock, flat hand for paper, and thier index and middle finger for scissors. Rock crushes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper covers rock. And see who wins the round each time. Alt text

Challenges that I faced
The challenge that i went during this project was javascript and know how to use it in the code. I never did javascrip or used it, that was a challenge for this project and seeing the error. The error waas a struggle for me and seeing how it was either the spelling. I see how the javascript works when everything can be rigt but there is only one thing that wrong can change the whole websit.
